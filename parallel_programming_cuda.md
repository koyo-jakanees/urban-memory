# Introduction to parallel programming;

I had the opportunity to attend the **the Nvidia DeepLearning Institute**  `Multi-GPU programming with C++` track. This section contains lesson and code sessions of the course.
Despite lack of prior knowledge to GPU programming, the session was generally great, and I got to be introduced to the amazing sphere of GPUs and 
C++ refresher.
The folder also contains lessons from [*Udacity's* `Intro to parallel Programming`](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGvfHSgImk4aweyWlhBXNF6XISY3um82_). This course also introduces Cuda programming, but incline towards the `C language dialect`.

**TODO**
Add short descriptive notes for cuda programming
